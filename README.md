# PORTFOLIO PAGE

As part of this week's homework, rather than develop a portfolio page for me personally, I have developed a page for my own consultancy company that will showcase the projects I have worked and experience, the type of work I do, and what I can offer to companies as a mining consultant that has web/app developer & data analytics skills to solve issues or implement digitised solutions for their operations. The reason for this is due to time limitations, and I want to use skills gained in the course to improve and value add to my existing portfolio of work.

The homework required using responsive CSS, and I have some more work to do with the clipping of background images for the parallax scrolling effect.

I have also some more work to do with adding pages for the Find Out More buttons in each section.

I have used javascript code to add some visual effects the video element in the header. I have also implemented some javascript for the parallax scrolling effect as I could not get the effect to work on some mobile devices such as ipads and iphones using CSS.

I do already have experience with jQuery and will be looking to replace some javascript functions with jQuery at a later stage.
